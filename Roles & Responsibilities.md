# Roles & Responsibilites 

The roles and responsibilities outlined on this page are specifically designed to be copied, adapted, and modified to fit the unique context of any organization. Understanding these defined functions is crucial for maximizing efficiency, ensuring every team contributes effectively to your overall security resilience, and achieving impactful vulnerability management outcomes.

# Security Team 

**Objective:** To proactively identify, assess, and manage security vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with relevant standards, and maintain the operational efficiency of security processes.

**Key Responsibilities:**

**Vulnerability Management:**
* Conduct regular vulnerability scanning of systems and applications.
* Perform manual penetration testing and security assessments for targeted areas.
* Define and implement an initial prioritization framework for identified vulnerabilities.
* Automate the initial prioritization of the majority of detected vulnerabilities based on predefined criteria (e.g., CVSS score, exploitability).
* Manually assess and prioritize a subset of vulnerabilities requiring expert judgment and contextual understanding.

**Security Alerting:**
* Define and implement alert rules for security vulnerabilities exceeding established severity thresholds.
* Ensure timely and accurate notification of relevant stakeholders for critical security findings.

**Compliance Monitoring:**
* Configure and maintain a centralized dashboard to monitor adherence to relevant security policies, standards, and regulations.
* Provide regular reports and insights on the organization's compliance posture.

**Security Operations Monitoring:**
* Monitor the performance and reliability of the security orchestration engine.
* Ensure that all security-related tickets generated by the orchestration engine are addressed within defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for initial assessment.
* Identify and escalate any bottlenecks or issues preventing timely processing of security tickets.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** \[Optional: Include relevant KPIs such as number of vulnerabilities identified, time to initial assessment, compliance score, etc.]

**Reporting To:** \[Insert Reporting Manager/Department]

# Product Owner Vulnerability Management

**Objective:** To own, develop, and monitor the vulnerability management function, maximizing the value of the vulnerability management program by defining, prioritizing, and driving the development and improvement of its tools and processes and their performance.

**Overall Purpose:** The Product Owner for Vulnerability Management is responsible for maximizing the value of the vulnerability management program by defining, prioritizing, and driving the development and improvement of its tools and processes and their performance. They act as the voice of the security team and other stakeholders, translating their needs into actionable items for the development team(s) supporting the vulnerability management function. They own the product backlog for the vulnerability management platform and related systems and are responsible for its prioritization and refinement.

**Key Responsibilities:**
* Define and align vulnerability management vision and strategy.
* Prioritize and manage backlog for vulnerability management platform and tools.
* Act as the vulnerability management champion.
* Monitor the vulnerability management process efficiency, effectiveness, and overall compliance.
* Lead threat monitoring/intelligence.
* Drive continuous improvement of vulnerability management.
* Translate security team and stakeholder needs into actionable development items.
* Own, prioritize, and refine the product backlog for the vulnerability management platform and related systems.

**Typical Activities:**
* Define and align vulnerability management vision and strategy.
* Prioritize and manage backlog for vulnerability management platform and tools.
* Act as the vulnerability management champion.
* Monitor the vulnerability management process efficiency, effectiveness, and overall compliance.
* Lead threat monitoring/intelligence.
* Improve vulnerability management.

**Required Skills:**
* Understanding of vulnerability management principles.
* Foundational knowledge of overall cybersecurity domains.
* Practical experience working within software development teams.

**KPIs:**
* Mean Time to Remediation.
* Number of Open Vulnerabilities.
* Vulnerability Remediation Coverage.
* Effectiveness of Vulnerability Scanning.

**Reports to:**
CISO, IT Security Officer or Head of Development.

# Development Team 

**Objective:** To proactively address security vulnerabilities within developed applications and infrastructure, ensuring the implementation of necessary remediation measures and maintaining secure development practices.

**Key Security Responsibilities:**

**Internal Vulnerability Assessment:**
* Conduct thorough internal assessments of security vulnerabilities specifically assigned to the development team.
* Document the findings of these internal assessments in a clear and comprehensive manner, adhering to established standards.

**Vulnerability Remediation:**
Execute necessary remediation actions for identified vulnerabilities, which may include:
* Applying updates and security patches to software components and systems.
* Implementing compensating security controls when immediate patching is not feasible.
* Removing vulnerable components or features as a final remediation measure.
* Ensure that all remediation activities are performed according to security best practices and organizational policies.
* Document all remediation steps taken, including configuration changes and testing results.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** \[Optional: Include relevant KPIs such as time to remediate vulnerabilities, number of vulnerabilities resolved, adherence to secure coding practices, etc.]
